# 🏧 .NET Console ATM Application

Welcome to my **.NET Console ATM application** — a personal project that I'm building from the ground up using C# and .NET.

This app started off with a **very simple architecture** — just the basics: a menu, an account class, and some basic banking operations. But this isn’t just another finished project I’m tossing on GitHub. Instead, this repository is about **documenting the journey** of how a real-world application is built and scaled over time.

## 🚀 Why This Project?

In the past, I used to only upload fully completed projects — polished, perfect, and done. But that meant missing the opportunity to:
- Show my thought process
- Track how I improve features and architecture
- Learn from mistakes and refactors
- Share real-time growth as a developer

So this time, I’m doing it differently. I’ll be updating this project consistently with:
- Major and minor **feature upgrades**
- **Code refactoring** and design improvements
- Clean, helpful **documentation**
- Thoughtful breakdowns of **what changed and why**

## 📌 What's the Goal?

This is more than just a console app — it's a **developer journal meets ATM simulator**. By the end of this journey, I aim to have:
- A robust, well-structured ATM system
- Clean separation of concerns (OOP, SOLID principles)
- Stronger knowledge of real-world app development in C#
- A GitHub repo that tells a story — not just shows a result

## 👨‍💻 Who This Is For

- **Developers** learning C# or console apps
- **Recruiters** interested in how I think and build
- **Future me** looking back at how far I've come
